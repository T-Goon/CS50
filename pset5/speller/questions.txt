0.  pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is an example of the longest word the program can check for spelling.
1.  It times how long a process takes.
2.  There are 2 parts to the rusage struct.
3.  The variables are passed by reference and not by value because it needs to be that way for the null check.
4.  The for loop gets one character from the file at a time and continues until it reaches the end of the file. Then it take those characters and puts them in a array. If the word is too long or contains a number the word will
    be skipped over. When it finds a character that is not a number, letter, or apostrophe it ends the word string with a /0. Then it adds one to the word count, checks to see if it is misspelled, and times how long
    it takes to check the spelling. If a misspelled word is found then the word is printed out and one is added to the misspelled words counter. This continues until the file ends.
5.  The reason why fgetc is used and not fscanf is that it is harder to check the word to things like length and if it contains a number. It is also harder to find the end of the file.
6.  They are declared with const to show that those variables should not change.
