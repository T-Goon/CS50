1.  stdint.h is a file that holds a bunch of macros and typedefs that makes code more portable.
2.  uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t are used in the program because after #include <stdint.h> various data types have had their name changed to uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t.
3.  BYTE is 1 byte long,  DWORD is 4 bytes, LONG is 4 bytes, and WORD is 2 bytes.
4.  The first 2 bytes of a BMP file has the letters'B' and 'M' in ASCII.
5.  The differece is that one of bfSize is the size if the bitmap in bytes and biSize is the number of bytes needed for the BITMAPINFOHEADER struct.
6.  If biHeight is negative it means that the bitmap is top-down.
7.  biBitCount determines BMP color depth.
8.  fopen might return NULL because the file that it has tried to open does not exist.
9.  fread's third argument always is a 1 because the bmp.h file only has one BITMAPFILEHEADER and RGBTRIPLE.
10. It returns 3.
11. fseek move the current position in a file to the desired one specifed by the second and third parameters.
12. SEEK_CUR is the current position of the pointer in the file.
